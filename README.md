Check your code for missing conditional surrounding your log output.

The `BuildConfig` class provides a constant, `DEBUG`, which indicates whether the code is being built in release mode
or in debug mode. In release mode, you typically want to strip out all the logging calls. Since the compiler will
automatically remove all code which is inside a `if (false)` check, surrounding your logging calls with a check for 
`BuildConfig.DEBUG` is a good idea.

If you *really* intend for the logging to be present in release mode, you can suppress this warning with a `@SuppressLint`
annotation for the intentional logging calls.

## Usage

Add this to your dependencies in the modules `build.gradle`

```kotlin
dependencies {
    lintChecks("com.cmgapps.lint:lint-log:<version>")
}
```
